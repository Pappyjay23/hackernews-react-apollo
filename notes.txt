* Why are there two GraphQL API layers in a backend architecture with Prisma?
Prisma provides the database layer which offers CRUD operations. The second layer is the application layer for business logic and common workflows (like authentication).

* What's the declarative way for loading data with React & Apollo?
Using the 'useQuery' hook and passing the GraphQL query document as an argument

** There are two top-level operation types in GraphQL: queries and mutations.
Queries are used when we want to read data.

Mutations are used when we want to change data. We use mutations when we want to create, update, or delete records.

* 'useMutation' hook provided by Apollo Client is used to send mutations to the GraphQL server
